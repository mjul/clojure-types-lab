;; t/ann adds an annotation to a var
;; We can type-check a function by annotating it this way:
(t/ann welcome-string [t/Str :-> t/Str])
(defn welcome-string [a-name]
  (str "Welcome, " a-name))

;; The type-checker checks that it conforms. It will fail if we
;; e.g. declare that it must return an integer:
;;
;;   (t/ann welcome-string [t/Str :-> t/Int])

;;; Type Error (...\clojure_types_lab\typed.clj:11:3)

;;; 
;;Expected: 	typed.clojure/Int
;;
;;Actual: 	typed.clojure/Str
;;;
;;;
;;in:
;;(str "Welcome, " a-name)


;; We can also annotate with wildcars, t/Any.
;; This is useful for the idiomatic predicates that pervade Clojure code.
;; See below for how we might refine this

       ;; (Typed Clojure 1.0.31)

;; We can even tell the type system that if the predicate is true
;; the argument x is a number. This is called occurrence typing.
;; It uses something called latent filters in Typed Clojure:
;; 0 is the first argument

                                }])

;; We can use t/print-env to inspect the type-checker's environment
;; at any given point when compiling. 
;; This is useful to troubleshoot problems.

  ;;;; {:env {x__#0 Number}, :props ((is typed.clojure/Num x__#0)), :aliases {}}

  ;; Here, you can see that the type-checker uses the pre-condition contract
  ;; to deduce that x is a number inside the function body. Pretty cool.

;; Let's try this latent filter in action:
(t/ann party-id? [t/Any :-> t/Bool :filters {:then (is Number 0)}])
(defn party-id? [x]
  (and (number? x)
       (int? x)

;; We can return a fixed map structure by specifying the keys and their values
(t/ann party [t/Int t/Str :-> '{:id t/Int :name t/Str}])
(defn party [id name]
  {:pre [(party-id? id)]}
  {:id id, :name name})

;; It would be convenient to define aliases for e.g. the Party map above.
;; We can do this with defalias:
(t/defalias Party '{:id t/Int :name t/Str})

;; Heterogeneous maps are maps with a minimum set of defined keys
;; E.g. if the parties to a contract are at least a buyer and a seller we can define it like this
(t/ann parties [Party Party
                :-> (t/HMap :mandatory {:buyer Party :seller Party})])
(defn parties
  [buyer seller]
  {:buyer buyer :seller seller})
